<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>My name is Alexander Titov. I am a CPU HW Architect/Micro-Architect/Researcher and EECS Lecturer.
I also like writing code in C++ and Python.</p>

<p>Finally, I managed to start my own personal site. I am going to use it to post my lectures, articles, and thoughts.</p>

<p>The site is hosted on <a href="pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> and powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>.
I found it quite easy (but, to be honest, I am familiar with <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">HTML</a> and
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">CSS</a>). I recommend following
<a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">this instruction</a> if you want to start your own site on
<a href="pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>

<p>Regards,<br>Alexander</p>
