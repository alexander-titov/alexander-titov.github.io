<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>I highly recommend watching <a href="https://youtu.be/etta_NYCVxA" title="Dave Ditzel's interview, youtube.com">the Dave Ditzel's interview</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/" title="www.computerhistory.org">the Computer History Museum</a>:</p>

<p>I found insterinsting the part (<a href="https://youtu.be/etta_NYCVxA?t=3848" title="Dave Ditzel's interview, youtube.com, starting at 1:04:08">1:04:08</a>) about his work with <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/pioneering-architect-soviet-era-computing/" title="Boris Babayan at newsroom.intel.com">Boris Babayan</a> at early 90-s. I have participated in several projectes led by Boris. He is, probably, the most exciting and talanted technical person I have ever met.</p>

<p>In addition, I would like to highlight the part (<a href="https://youtu.be/etta_NYCVxA?t=4338" title="Dave Ditzel's interview, youtube.com, starting at 1:12:18">1:12:18</a>) where Dave is talking about the Intel's Moscow team. He describes the project we did that time as <q>probably, the single most innovated architecture at Intel</q>.</p>

<p>Regards,<br>Alexander Titov</p>
